            <p class="lead">
              I've always been curious about how things work. Not just the surface—the mechanics, the decisions, the systems that make something succeed or fail. That curiosity drives most of what I do.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
              I'm drawn to marketing, sales, systems, and business growth because they're where ideas meet reality. They're where you learn what resonates, what scales, and what falls flat. I like figuring that out.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
              That's why I build websites, brands, and tools—not as a hobby, but as a way to learn. Every project teaches something new: how to structure information, how to connect with people, how to turn an idea into something usable.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
              I'm more energized by creating than consuming, so most of my free time turns into learning, experimenting, or building something new. It's not about hustle—it's about staying engaged with what interests me.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
              I'm based in McKinney, Texas, where I split time between building, writing, and capturing the details around me. If that resonates, I'd enjoy hearing from you.
