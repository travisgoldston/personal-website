          Over time I've noticed a few areas where I keep putting energy: learning, experimenting, getting better.

            <h2 class="useful-item-title">Making complicated things simple</h2>
            <p class="lead">
              I get a lot out of taking something dense or confusing and turning it into something anyone can follow. Not dumbing it down. Finding the clearest path through. When someone says "oh, I get it," that's the signal I'm after.

            <h2 class="useful-item-title">SEO and organic growth</h2>
            <p class="lead">
              I care about how search and discovery actually work. What helps people find what they need. What helps good content surface. I've spent a lot of time trying different structures, content, and ways to measure. I'd rather build something that earns visibility over time than try to game a system.

            <h2 class="useful-item-title">Systems and process thinking</h2>
            <p class="lead">
              I like seeing how pieces fit together and where they break. When something keeps going wrong or taking too long, I want to map it, simplify it, make it repeatable. Good systems don't need to be fancy. They just need to work and be easy to follow.

          <article class="useful-item">
            <h2 class="useful-item-title">Marketing strategy and messaging</h2>
            <p class="lead">
              Figuring out what to say, to whom, and when is a puzzle I enjoy. I think a lot about positioning, voice, and how messaging ties to real outcomes. Clarity is the goal. Does this land? Feel true? Give someone a reason to care?

          <article class="useful-item">
            <h2 class="useful-item-title">Tracking and measurement using spreadsheets and dashboards</h2>
            <p class="lead">
              I like turning data into something you can use. Clean spreadsheets, clear dashboards, views that answer "what's going on?" without a lot of digging. The discipline is asking the right questions first, then building the simplest structure that answers them.

          <article class="useful-item">
            <h2 class="useful-item-title">Leadership and developing people</h2>
            <p class="lead">
              I care about helping people get better at what they do and feel supported doing it. Clear expectations, honest feedback, space to take ownership. The best outcomes happen when people understand why something matters and have room to figure out how to do it.

          <article class="useful-item">
            <h2 class="useful-item-title">Building digital things: websites, brands, and content</h2>
            <p class="lead">
              I like making things that exist in the world. A site that works. A brand that feels coherent. Content that's useful or interesting. Each one is a chance to learn: how structure affects experience, how words and design work together, what it takes to ship something people actually use.
