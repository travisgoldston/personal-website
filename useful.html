          Over time, I've noticed a few areas where I naturally spend a lot of energy learning, experimenting, and improving.

            <h2 class="useful-item-title">Making complicated things simple</h2>
            <p class="lead">
              I get a lot of satisfaction from taking something dense or confusing and turning it into something anyone can follow. It's not about dumbing things down—it's about finding the clearest path through. When the idea lands and someone says "oh, I get it," that's the signal I'm aiming for.

            <h2 class="useful-item-title">SEO and organic growth</h2>
            <p class="lead">
              I'm drawn to how search and discovery actually work—what helps people find what they need, and what helps good content surface. I've spent a lot of time experimenting with structure, content, and measurement. The part I care about most is building something that earns visibility over time, not gaming a system.

            <h2 class="useful-item-title">Systems and process thinking</h2>
            <p class="lead">
              I like understanding how pieces fit together and where things break. When something keeps going wrong or taking too long, I want to map it, simplify it, and make it repeatable. Good systems don't have to be fancy—they just have to work and be easy to follow.

            <h2 class="useful-item-title">Marketing strategy and messaging</h2>
            <p class="lead">
              Figuring out what to say, to whom, and when is a puzzle I enjoy. I think a lot about positioning, voice, and how messaging connects to real outcomes. The goal is always clarity: does this land? Does it feel true? Does it give someone a reason to care?

          <article class="useful-item">
            <h2 class="useful-item-title">Tracking and measurement using spreadsheets and dashboards</h2>
            <p class="lead">
              I like turning data into something you can actually use—clean spreadsheets, clear dashboards, and views that answer "what's going on?" without a lot of digging. The discipline is asking the right questions first, then building the simplest structure that answers them.

          <article class="useful-item">
            <h2 class="useful-item-title">Leadership and developing people</h2>
            <p class="lead">
              I care about helping people get better at what they do and feel supported while they're doing it. That means clear expectations, honest feedback, and creating space for them to take ownership. The best outcomes come when people understand the why and have room to figure out the how.

          <article class="useful-item">
            <h2 class="useful-item-title">Building digital things—websites, brands, and content</h2>
            <p class="lead">
              I like making things that exist in the world: a site that works, a brand that feels coherent, content that's useful or interesting. Each one is a chance to learn—how structure affects experience, how words and design work together, and what it takes to ship something people actually use.
