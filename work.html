            <h2 class="section-title" style="margin-bottom: var(--space-lg);">Local SEO Experiments</h2>
            <p class="lead" style="margin-bottom: var(--space-lg);">
              I ran a series of experiments to understand how local search rankings work—testing on-page optimization, schema markup, and content structure. The goal wasn't to game the system, but to learn what actually moves the needle for local visibility.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
              I built and optimized several local-focused sites, tracked ranking shifts, and documented what worked. The biggest takeaway: consistency and structure matter more than quick tricks. Good, clear content with proper structure tends to win over time.

            <p class="lead" style="margin-bottom: var(--space-lg);">
              A small weekend project with a friend, focused on content creation, email marketing, and overall marketing strategy for a budgeting-related brand. We didn't build the product—we worked on how to talk about it. It ran entirely on the side, on weekends, without touching full-time work.
            </p>
            <p class="lead" style="margin-bottom: var(--space-lg);">
              The real goal was learning: how to say things in extremely simple language, how to adjust tone and voice so it felt like a conversation with everyday people, and how to write copy that was clear and never redundant. We also had to think through marketing strategy and messaging from the ground up—what to say, to whom, and when.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
              Reflecting on it, the biggest takeaway was how much discipline it takes to keep things simple. It's tempting to add more words or ideas; the harder, more valuable skill is stripping them away until what's left is easy to understand and easy to act on.

            <p class="lead" style="margin-bottom: var(--space-lg);">
              I've designed and built multiple sites and brand concepts as a way to explore how design communicates. Each project was a chance to try different typography, color systems, and layout approaches.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
              What I learned: restraint is underrated. The best designs often come from saying no—fewer fonts, fewer colors, more white space. I'm drawn to minimal, confident layouts that let content lead.
