              I ran experiments to see how local search rankings actually work. I tested page optimization, schema markup, and content structure. Not to game the system, just to learn what moves the needle.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
              I built and optimized several sites aimed at local search, tracked how rankings shifted, and wrote down what worked. Consistency and structure beat quick tricks. Clear content with solid structure tends to win over time.

            <p class="lead" style="margin-bottom: var(--space-lg);">
              A small weekend project with a friend. We worked on content, email, and marketing strategy for a brand in the budgeting space. We didn't build the product. We worked on how to talk about it. Everything happened on the side, on weekends, without touching my full time work.
            </p>
            <p class="lead" style="margin-bottom: var(--space-lg);">
              The real goal was learning. How to say things in very simple language. How to adjust tone so it felt like a real conversation with everyday people. How to write copy that was clear and never redundant. We also had to think through strategy and messaging from scratch: what to say, to whom, when.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
              Looking back, the biggest takeaway was how much discipline it takes to keep things simple. Easy to add more words. The harder skill is stripping them away until what's left is easy to understand and act on.

              I've designed and built multiple sites and brand concepts to explore how design communicates. Each project was a chance to try different typography, color, and layout.

            <p class="lead">
              Restraint is underrated. The best work usually comes from saying no. Fewer fonts, fewer colors, more white space. I like minimal layouts that feel confident and let content lead.
